## About the Tracker
Every month, the Local Leader should report his activities to IxDA global using IxDA tracker, an old software, but functional. The Tracker adds much value to us, but unfortunately, it doesn't work anymore because the technology used is too old and, we can't forget to mention, almost impossible to maintain.

This project introduces a new user experience, more functionalities, and more value to IxDA.
